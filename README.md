# Predicting the Likelihood of an Airbnb Listing to be Cancelled by the Host

## Applied various Machine Learning models (linear regression, lasso regression, random forest, decision trees and gradient boosting) to arrive at an R-squared value of 0.61 on prediction of number of cancellations by each Airbnb listing


### Data

In this project, I focus on the Airbnb market in London, the second largest Airbnb city outside the US. 

Most of the datasets used in this project were all found on insideairbnb.com. This website “is an independent, non-commercial set of tools and data that allows you to explore how Airbnb is really being used in cities around the world.”
